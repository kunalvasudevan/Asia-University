#Sentiment Analysis :
As we all know that we are studying text mining in which we are doing text analysis, to make our work easier we are using sentiment analysis .
#Translate :
I got the motivation to do the program of converting one language to another because, as we all know that the current course that we are pursuing is from Asia university, that is situated in Taiwan and currently I'm in India. so, I thought it will be very easy and Feasible to create an application That helps you to translate language. 
#Text To Speech :
we all belong to different region, so we have communication issues ,Although we know a common language like English but due to our region, We have different pronunciation for same word. To solve this issues, we have created text to speech program. 
#Chat Bot :
Communication between person to person takes time to reduce this time be a created board that will communicate with the user and jeeva's answers accordingly for example we have done for pizza ordering system .
